# Princess-Problem
Path to Princess & Linked List Implementation 

This project contains two different Python programs that demonstrate algorithmic problem-solving and data structure implementation.

The first program is based on the classic Path to Princess problem. In this task, a bot (m) must rescue the princess (p) who is trapped somewhere in an N × N grid. The program identifies the positions of both characters and prints the sequence of moves required for the bot to reach the princess. Movements are represented as UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. This part of the project highlights how grid-based problems can be solved using simple coordinate tracking and step-by-step navigation.

The second program is an implementation of a singly linked list in Python. A linked list is a fundamental data structure where elements (nodes) are connected using pointers. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the list. The script demonstrates how to define a Node class, create multiple nodes, link them together, and traverse the list for printing. The example provided creates a list of three nodes (10 → 20 → 30) and displays it in a readable format.

Together, these programs illustrate two important areas of computer science: algorithmic thinking (solving navigation problems in a grid) and data structures (linked list implementation). Both are essential concepts for building a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving.
